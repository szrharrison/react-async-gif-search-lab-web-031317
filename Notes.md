# Giphy Search!

### Instructions

You're going to be building out a Gif search using the Giphy API. The URL for the API is

`http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=YOUR QUERY HERE&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC`

Our app will be responsible for fetching the data from the giphy api based on user input, and storing the first 3 gifs from the response.
